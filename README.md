## Description
I've created a simple note taker application. When opening the home page, the user is presented with a landing page with a link to the note page. When the user clicks on the button, they are taken to the application. The user inserts a title and a description for the note, a save button appears. When the user presses the save button, the note is saved and displays on the left hand column with other existing notes. When an existing note in the list in the left-hand column is clicked, then that note appears in the right hand column.

## Technologies

1. Visual Studio Code
2. Node.js
